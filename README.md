# Quasi-Static Scheduling for Deterministic Timed Concurrent Models on Multi-Core Hardware

### Research Question
Real-time embedded software aims to be predictable and efficient to run. To this end, _(quasi-)static scheduling_ has been applied extensively on a variety of concurrent models of computation, including [SDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_Data_Flow), [BDF](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/ptolemyclassic/almagest/docs/user/html/domains.doc5.html), [SADF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6045491), and [LET](https://cs.uni-salzburg.at/~anas/papers/ARTS-chapter.pdf).
These existing techniques for generating schedules at compile time are strikingly similar across models.

In this paper, we ask the question â€” "Can these existing methods be _unified_ and _generalized_ for future models of computation?"

### Key Idea

The answer presented in this paper is **State Space Finite Automata (SSFA)**, an intermediate formalism bridging a model of computation and its underlying (quasi-)static schedules.

In a nutshell, an SSFA is a state machine where each state contains a DAG task set.
The SSFA should be derived from a high-level model of computation,
and we define deterministic timed concurrent models (DTCMs) to be a class of models that supports deriving SSFAs from models' semantics.

Once an SSFA is constructed, a quasi-static schedule can be produced by partitioning each DAG task set based on the number of available cores.

### Application

This repository shows how to apply the SSFA-based quasi-static scheduling technique to a synchronous subset of Lingua Franca (LF), which is an emerging programming model for cyber-physical systems.

Above shows a satellite attitude controller modelled in Lingua Franca (LF).
To perform quasi-static scheduling on this LF model, our extended LF compiler generates an SSFA (shown in the 1st figure) from the input LF model, partitions all DAGs in the SSFA, and generates executable schedules using an IR that can be interpreted by the LF runtime system.

This repository contains:
1. Code for a performance benchmark: README,
2. Code for a satellite attitude control case study: README.

## Getting started

### Requirements
- Linux environment, tested on Ubuntu 24.04
- Java 17, download [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)


### Setup

1. Install dependencies
```shell
sudo apt install cmake verilator sbt 
```

2. Clone repo with submodule
```shell
git clone https://github.com/icyphy/pretvm-artifacts --recursive
```

3. Build the lingua franca compiler
```shell
cd lingua-franca
./gradlew assemble
```

4. Build the FlexPRET emulator

First download and install riscv-none-elf-gcc-14.2.0-2

```shell
  wget -q --show-progress https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/releases/download/v14.2.0-2/xpack-riscv-none-elf-gcc-14.2.0-2-linux-x64.tar.gz -O gcc.tar.gz
  tar xvf gcc.tar.gz --directory=/opt
```

Then source `env.bash` in the root of this artifact repo, it will add some environmental variables needed for the rest of the install and also when running programs

```shell
source env.bash
```

Then build the FlexPRET emulator and the FlexPRET SDK
```shell
cd flexpret
cmake -B build && cd build
make all install

cd sdk
cmake -B build && cd build
make
```

5. HelloWorld to verify installation
TODO: Add this step.


### WCET

You can either build the docker image yourself or pull it from dockerhub.

**Building it Yourself**
```bash
    $ sudo docker build ./docker -t einspaten/rtas25:v2
```

**Pulling it from Dockerhub**
```bash
    $ sudo docker pull einspaten/rtas25:v2
```

**Using the Docker Image**
```bash
    $ sudo docker run -ti -v ${PWD}/docker/:/root/rtas25/ -v ${PWD}/satellite-controller:/root/rtas25/satellite-controller -v ${PWD}/pretvm-instructions:/root/rtas25/pretvm-instructions einspaten/rtas25:v2
    $ ./analyse-all.sh
```

## TODOs
- [ ] Bring EGS as a submodule here and document how to set it up using a virtual environment etc,
- [ ] Create a FlexPRET config used for the EMSOFT submission so others easily can build it  
- [ ] Add the source links here and how to run the script to compile and do WCET analysis
